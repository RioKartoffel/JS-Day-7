# JS-Day-7
Split Landing Page

- The HTML part of the code sets up the structure of the page, including the head and body sections. The head section includes the meta information, the title of the page, and links to the CSS and JavaScript files. The body section includes two sections with class "split", representing the two sides of a split-screen layout, each containing an H1 heading and a link.
- The CSS part of the code sets the styles for the elements of the HTML. It sets the font, colors, positions, and animations for the text, links, and background images of the page.
- The JavaScript part of the code is not included in this code snippet, but it would have further functionality added to the page. This JavaScript code uses event listeners to listen for mouseenter and mouseleave events on the left and right elements. When the mouse enters one of the elements, it adds the class **`.hover-left`**or **`.hover-right`**to the container element, causing the CSS styles to change and animate the widths of the left and right elements. When the mouse leaves, it removes the class and resets the widths.
